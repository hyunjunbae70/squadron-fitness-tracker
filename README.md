Squadron Fitness Tracker

A web application built to replace the Excel-based fitness tracking system used in my squadron. It allows personnel to log workouts, view their progress, and compare performance across the unit.

Why I Built It

Our squadron tracked PT sessions manually, which caused errors and made it hard to keep people motivated. I built this tool to automate the process and add competitive features that encouraged participation.

Key Features

User accounts and profiles with session-based authentication

Workout logging for running, strength training, and bodyweight exercises

Progress charts using Chart.js

Squadron leaderboard to encourage friendly competition

Mobile-friendly interface for quick logging after PT sessions

Tech Stack

Backend: Flask (Python), SQLite

Frontend: HTML/CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Chart.js

Auth: Sessions with password hashing (Werkzeug)

Exercise Data Tracked

Running (time + distance)

Strength exercises (weight, sets, reps)

Bodyweight movements

Squadron PT events

Outcome

After introducing the app, participation increased noticeably because people could see their stats and compare themselves on the leaderboard. It also removed the need for spreadsheets entirely.
